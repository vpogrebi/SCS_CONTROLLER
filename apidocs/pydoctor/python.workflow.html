workflow.py is responsible for SCS controller's WORKFLOW implementation 

Classes:
    1. WorkflowManager -    Main (public) class. Subclasses from twisted.application.service.MultiService, essentially
                            exposing workflow (_Workflow class) entities as services. This class is 
                            responsible for: 
                                - starting/stopping _Workflow services
                                - enabling/disabling _Workflow entities
                                - accessing individual _Workflow entities
                                - adding online/offline deferreds to individual _Workflow entities
                            
                            This class Implements IResourceManager interface
                            
    2. _WorkflowService -   Wraps individual workflow functionality (_Workflow) as service. 
                            This class subclasses from twisted.application.service.MultiService and is responsible for
                            starting/stopping individual workflows, as well as for initializing log and error files 
                            associated with each _Workflow entity
                            
    3. _Workflow -          Implements workflow functionality. This class is responsible for:
                                - setting SCSClient instances associated with the given workflow. This is the main purpose
                                  of having this class. Client entities associated with the workflow define sequence and 
                                  relationship of job steps (JobStep instances) needed to perform each job (Job instance)
                                - enabling/disabling workflow. This feature can (potentially) be used during production 
                                  support issues to temporarily take any workflow "offline"
                                - adding online/offline deferreds that can be used to react to changes in workflow 'online' status
                                - reacting to SCS client entity's loss and restoration of connection with external server                        </pre>
