Instructions for alternate python install
-----------------------------------------

Motivation: Most of our systems are RHEL/CENT and have python 2.4 installed as the default. Upgrading my break utilities such as yum. However, many of our software products are designed for python 2.5.

Solution: Use the alternate install method of python to install 2.5.4 side by side with 2.4

Instructions:

1) become root

2) cd to /usr/src

3) download python 2.5.4 source, decompress, cd into python directory

4) run ./configure

5) run make

VERY IMPORTANT

6) instead of "make" type "make altinstall"

7) be sure when installing libraries for use with python 2.5 that you change the location of the python executiable to point to /usr/local/bin/python2.5 vice the default python (which is normally located via the python env variable). This may require modifying the setup.py file and calling python2.5 vice python
